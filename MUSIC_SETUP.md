### Current Audio Files
The game is currently using:
- **Background Music**: `assets/audios/–ü–µ—Å–Ω—è –¥–ª—è —Ç–≤–æ–µ–≥–æ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∞.mp3`
- **Boss Voice**: `assets/audios/Tralalero Tralala Sound Effect.mp3`

These local audio files provide:
- ‚úÖ **Fast Loading**: No network requests needed
- ‚úÖ **Offline Support**: Works without internet connection
- ‚úÖ **Reliable**: No external dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Platform**: Works on all platforms
- ‚úÖ **No Conflicts**: Separate audio contexts prevent interference

### Adding Your Own Music

To replace the current audio file with your own track:

1. **Replace the audio file** in `assets/audios/` folder
2. **Update the Music URL** in `components/MusicControls.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   const musicUrl = require('../assets/audios/YOUR_MUSIC_FILE.mp3');
   ```

2. **Supported Formats**:
   - MP3 (recommended)
   - WAV
   - AAC
   - OGG

3. **Recommended Sources**:
   - Local files in `assets/audios/` folder (best performance)
   - Upload to a cloud service (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
   - Use a direct download link
   - Host on your own server
   - Use a CDN for better performance

### Adding Boss Voice Effects

To add voice effects for bosses:

1. **Add audio file** to `assets/audios/` folder
2. **Update boss data** in `constants/game.ts`:
   ```typescript
   {
     id: 'boss_id',
     name: 'Boss Name',
     // ... other properties
     voice: require('../assets/audios/boss_voice.mp3'),
   }
   ```

3. **Voice files should be**:
   - Short (2-5 seconds recommended)
   - High quality but compressed
   - Representative of the boss character

### Example Music URLs
```typescript
// Local asset (recommended for best performance)
const musicUrl = require('../assets/audios/background-music.mp3');

// Google Drive (make sure to set sharing to "Anyone with the link")
const musicUrl = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=YOUR_FILE_ID';

// Direct download link
const musicUrl = 'https://example.com/path/to/your/music.mp3';

// CDN link
const musicUrl = 'https://cdn.example.com/music/background.mp3';
```

## Technical Details

### Audio Services Architecture
- **`services/audioService.ts`**: Main unified audio service for background music
- **`services/soundEffectService.ts`**: Service for boss voice effects
- **`services/webAudioService.ts`**: Web-specific implementation for background music
- **`services/webSoundEffectService.ts`**: Web-specific implementation for sound effects
- **`components/MusicControls.tsx`**: UI component for music controls

### Platform Detection & Audio Contexts
The system automatically detects the platform and uses the appropriate audio implementation:
- **Mobile**: Uses `expo-av` for native audio with separate sound objects
- **Web**: Uses separate Web Audio contexts for background music and sound effects

### Integration Points
The music controls are automatically added to:
- Main menu (`app/index.tsx`)
- Game screen (`app/game.tsx`)

Boss voice effects are integrated in:
- Boss selector (`components/BossSelector.tsx`)

### Audio Context Separation
- **Background Music**: Uses dedicated audio context for looping music
- **Sound Effects**: Uses separate audio context for one-shot boss voices
- **No Interference**: Each audio type operates independently
- **Volume Control**: Separate volume management for each context

## Troubleshooting

### Music Not Playing (Mobile)
1. Check if the music URL is accessible
2. Verify the audio file format is supported
3. Ensure the device volume is not muted
4. Check app permissions for audio playback
5. Make sure `expo-av` is properly installed

### Music Not Playing (Web)
1. **User Interaction**: Make sure to interact with the page first (click anywhere) - browser requirement
2. Check browser console for audio context errors
3. Verify the music URL is accessible and CORS-enabled
4. Ensure the browser supports Web Audio API
5. Try refreshing the page if audio context fails

### Boss Voice Effects Not Working
1. Check if the boss has a voice file assigned
2. Verify the audio file path is correct
3. Ensure the sound effect service is initialized
4. Check browser console for errors (web)
5. Try clicking the boss again

### Play Button Issues (Fixed)
1. **Issue**: Play button was triggering boss voices instead of background music
2. **Solution**: Separated audio contexts for background music and sound effects
3. **Result**: Play button now only controls background music

### Volume Issues
1. Make sure the device volume is turned up
2. Check if the app has audio permissions
3. Try restarting the app
4. On web, check if the audio context is active

### Performance Issues
1. Use compressed audio formats (MP3, AAC)
2. Keep file sizes reasonable (< 10MB recommended)
3. Consider using streaming URLs for large files
4. On web, ensure the audio file is properly cached

### Web-Specific Issues
1. **Audio Context Suspended**: Click anywhere on the page to resume
2. **CORS Errors**: Ensure your audio file allows cross-origin requests
3. **Browser Autoplay Policy**: User interaction is required to start audio
4. **Audio Format Support**: Use MP3 for maximum browser compatibility
5. **Multiple Audio Contexts**: System now uses separate contexts to prevent conflicts

## Recent Fixes
